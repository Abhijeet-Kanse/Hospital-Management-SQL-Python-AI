##  🔍 Analytics & Insights
### Q1:What is the trend of patient registrations over time?
```
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(registration_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
       COUNT(*) AS new_patients
FROM Patients
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month
limit 10;
```

---

### Q2: Doctor Workload
📌 Identifies **most-consulted doctors** for better scheduling.
 
```
SELECT d.doctor_id, d.first_name, d.last_name, d.specialization,
       COUNT(a.appointment_id) AS total_appointments
FROM Doctors d
LEFT JOIN Appointments a ON d.doctor_id = a.doctor_id
GROUP BY d.doctor_id, d.first_name, d.last_name, d.specialization
ORDER BY total_appointments DESC;
```

### Q3: Treatment Revenue
📌 Shows **most profitable treatments** for hospital strategy. 
```
SELECT t.treatment_type, SUM(b.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM Treatments t
JOIN Billing b ON t.treatment_id = b.treatment_id
GROUP BY t.treatment_type
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

    SUM(CASE WHEN payment_status = 'Paid' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS paid_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN payment_status = 'Pending' OR payment_status = 'Default' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS unpaid_count,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN payment_status = 'Pending' OR payment_status = 'Default' THEN amount ELSE 0 END), 2) AS total_unpaid_amount,
    ROUND(AVG(amount), 2) AS avg_bill_amount
FROM Billing
GROUP BY payment_method
ORDER BY total_bills DESC;
```
